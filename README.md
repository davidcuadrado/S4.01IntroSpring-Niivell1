# S4.01IntroSpring-Nivell1

📄 Description

This is an introductory-level project using Spring Boot, designed to demonstrate how to create a basic application with web functionalities and database access using JPA.

💻 Used technologies

· Eclipse IDE 2024-03 · Spring Boot 3.3.4

📋 Prerquisites

· Java 17 or higher. · Maven 3.6+

🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>

Navigate to the project directory:
cd project-name Build the project using Maven: mvn clean install

▶️ Execution

To run the application locally, you can use Maven or the jar file generated in the target folder:

With Maven:

mvn spring-boot:run

Running the JAR file:

java -jar target/filename.jar

🔑 Key Features

REST API: This project exposes RESTful endpoints to manage resources via HTTP. Data Access with JPA: The project uses Spring Data JPA to interact with the relational database.

🌐 Deployment To deploy the application to a production environment, follow these steps:

Build the application: Ensure the application is properly built by generating an executable JAR:
mvn clean package

Prepare the environment: · Make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) compatible with Java 17 or higher. · Set up a database (if necessary), and configure the application’s properties (like database URL, credentials, etc.) in application.properties.

Deploying on a cloud service or VM: You can deploy the built JAR file directly on a virtual machine or cloud platform like AWS EC2, Google Cloud, or Azure. Use the following command to run the application:

java -jar target/filename.jar

Containerized Deployment (Optional): If using Docker, build the Docker image and run the container:
mvn spring-boot:build-image docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name

Ensure that the container is configured to run in your desired cloud environment or orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes).

CI/CD Integration: For continuous deployment, integrate your repository with a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) that automatically builds and deploys the application upon commits or merges to the main branch.
